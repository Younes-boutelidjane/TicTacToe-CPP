# Tic-Tac-Toe Game in C++

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game written in C++. The game allows players to play against each other or against an AI opponent.

## How to Play

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Younes-BoutelidjaneTicTacToe-CPP.git
```

2. Compile the code:
```bash
g++ main.cpp TicTacToe.cpp -o tictactoe
```
3. Run the executable:
```bash
./tictactoe
```

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game.

## Features

- Player vs Player: Two players can play against each other.
- Player vs AI: Play against a simple AI opponent.
- Randomized AI Moves: The AI opponent makes random moves in the player vs AI mode.

## Gameplay

Players take turns to place their mark (X or O) on a 3x3 grid. The first player to get three of their marks in a row, column, or diagonal wins the game. If all cells on the grid are filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
